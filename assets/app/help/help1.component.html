                                                Authentication is an absolutely essential element of a typical security model. It is the process of confirming the identification of a user (or in some cases, a machine) that is trying to log on or access resources. There are a number of different authentication mechanisms, but all serve this same purpose.

In this context, access is the ability of an individual user to perform a specific task, such as view, create, or modify a file.
