                                Commodity service is the service which does not provide any competitive advantage to your business but required in order for business to operate. (Example SSO, Directory Services, NTP, SMTP, Ticketing System, CMDB, ITMS etcâ€¦). If your app is custom developed but type of service it provides can be replaced by 3rd party SaaS offerings - SaaS sollution may be very appealing.

Best Buy has already evaluated and underwrote  all major cloud providers but smaller CSPs may still need to be approved and underwritten. Do not migrate to CSP without talking to Legal/Security/Data Governance first.
