                                        When it comes to Cloud, assumption should be made that your infrastructure will eventually fail and any High Availability (HA) and Fault Tolerance (FT) requirements application might have should be architected at Application Layer.
                                        If your application relies on SLA of the Data Center Infrastructure and requires over 99.95% uptime – re-hosting as-is is not an option since all 3 CSPs have SLAs of 99.95% for their IaaS VMs and only when properly configured.

                                        Traditional IP communication allows a host to send packets to a single host (unicast transmission) or to all hosts (broadcast transmission). IP multicast provides a third possibility: allowing a host to send packets to a subset of all hosts as a group transmission. Major Cloud Providers do not support multicast and 3rd party tools must be used. So, an as-is migration may not be possible.  Most likely multicast is not used in BBY.
